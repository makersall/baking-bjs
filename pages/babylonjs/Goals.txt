3 spheres
- Using colors
- Using a gradient
- Animation over several years?

Animation of levels
- Membership email opt out
- Cost of membership email opt out
- Social mobility? Or member involvement? (Showing how critical member involvement is in the first year)

Animated characters
- Running character moving up levels, with commentary (an example of 2D)
- Pieces of the puzzle

3's super simple examples for learning how to code:
- create some stuff
- Using the variable, see you don't have a weird number in the middle of your code; for example, good score versus bad score
- Storing your data in a list, using a loop
- Using an if statement
I don't necessarily have to create the examples, I just need to describe them.

Notes:
- This first round: focus not on_what_best to communicate but rather what's possible -- what ingredients, what tools. Especially because I'm a developer, not a graphics designer
- 3 types of 3D data visualization:
  - To most effectively communicate a story
  - To get folks fired up -- not uncommon with groups trying to hit goals to do something creative. For example, each year you set goals, so have a graphics designer come up with animated characters you're going to use to represent goals that year
  - To add sizzle because you need people to pay attention  :-)



INSPIRATIONS:

And then I could try:
- Showing only certain parts of a GLFT as a way of displaying progress
  - start with "https://www.babylonjs.com/Assets/FlightHelmet/glTF/"
  - call inspector from the code
  - Try using a sandwich!

- Creating an abstract map
  - Of a few states where you have offices
