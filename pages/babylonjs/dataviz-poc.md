  * * UNDER CONSTRUCTION * * 

<p> The following are a few simple data visualization experiments. Most of them don't follow dataviz best practices, and they need work to make them prettier. The purpose of these examples is to rough out what's involved in doing a data visualization using BabylonJS. </p>

<p> NOTE: something recently changed in the BabylonJS library that's causing any example that loads an asset to fail -- I'll figure this out when I have the time.</p>
