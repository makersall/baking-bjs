You can display the Inspector by calling:

scene.debugLayer.show();
The show function will return a promise that you can use to know when the Inspector is loaded and visible.

Loading
Provided your project is running on a server the Inspector is automatically loaded from the BabylonJS server whenit is called as above. 

The latest version of the inspector can be pulled from: https://preview.babylonjs.com/inspector/babylon.inspector.bundle.js

You can update this URL by setting the variable:

BABYLON.DebugLayer.InspectorURL = 'http://myurl/babylon.inspector.bundle.js';
To use the Inspector when your project is stored and run locally with an internet connection then you need to load the Inspector directly
