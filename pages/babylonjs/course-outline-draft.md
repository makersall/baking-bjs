Intro, Part 1
-	Overview: stepping into a new area (jargon, what problems trying to solve, what obstacles to overcome that shape the tools you use), for 3d games & implications of that
-	Simple ball, box
-	3 balls of different colors
-	3 balls with different effects (aka materials)
-	Now play w it: get comfortable positioning in 3d

Intro, Part 2	
-	Set color based on value — aka if statement, constants for materials
-	Set color shade based on value and math — RHSMT
-	End w sizzle:  Background pix/environment 
  - Homework:	Start thinking about: what backgrounds would make sense? 

Next round:
-	Array to hold your data 
-	3 balls from a loop — revenge of your high school math teacher
-	3 “floors” off of array  — simple math on a different axis, boxes instead of balls
-	Day ends w simple grid?


Next round:
-	Functions — do early on, so you get baby steps into tool maker, not just tool user: setting up so other folks can change data, use for other purposes 
-	Labels/Text
-	Rules of good data viz

When to do version control
Inspector
Debugging
Debugging tools


-	When Start using Vector3?

Time to take off the training wheels!
When start using materials directly?
Lights, cameras?
