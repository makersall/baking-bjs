### Text

- Note: Textbody GUI seems like way to go
- [Labels](https://www.babylonjs-playground.com/#M50WUZ#4)
- [Documentation](https://doc.babylonjs.com/how_to/gui#textblock)
- [Another example](https://www.babylonjs-playground.com/#2ARI2W#10). "Please note that to get crisp texts you have to ensure that your rendering resolution is aligned with the screen... This example you can see on line #3 that we force the engine to get the same DPI as the screen. Then on lines #10 and #11 we scale the GUI to align with the screen resolution."
- [Discussion of strategies](http://www.html5gamedevs.com/topic/38512-2d-text-in-world-space/)


### Animation

Where animation esp useful: GLTF characters with built in animations— the fat that it’s only one value not as big a deal. But doing an animation where you want to change several things— like x and y— chews up a bunch of code since you need an animation for each

- [BabylonJS team member turorial on Smashing Mag](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/07/babylon-js-building-sponza-a-cross-platform-webgl-game/)


### Color Tricks

- [Translate between colors, colors using hex values](https://www.babylonjs-playground.com/#FZTGQE#8). Try BABYLON.Color3.lerptoref
- [Documentation](https://doc.babylonjs.com/api/classes/babylon.color3#teal)
- NOTE: use FromHexString(hex: string): Color3
- Random(): Color3
- Lerp(start: DeepImmutable<Color3>, end: DeepImmutable<Color3>, amount: number): Color3. Creates a new Color3 with values linearly interpolated of "amount" between the start Color3 and the end Color3
