<p> Although BabylonJS is really powerful, if you aren't a programmer getting started can be intimidating. Here are some basic examples, some of whom are simplified versions of examples in BabylonJS' tutorials, that can make it a little easier to get your feet wet.</p>

</ul>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li> If you're creating a basic shape, use MeshBuilder. A lot of the older examples on the playground don't, and they just don't look as good -- the defaults on MeshBuilder are much better. <blockquote>var sphere = BABYLON.MeshBuilder.CreateSphere("sphere", {diameter: 2}, scene);</blockquote></li>
</ul>


<h2>BabylonJS Resources</h2>
