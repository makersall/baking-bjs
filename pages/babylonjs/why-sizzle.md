{Explain why I ended up mostly doing eye candy for this version:
- I'm not a graphic designer, so trying to figure out a new library, which included a lot of concepts from the world of 3D graphics that I'd never run across before, and also figuring out what works and doesn't work when you are visualizing data in 3D was too much -- especially because the obvious example, using maps, doesn't make sense to do because Google, Microsoft, etc. are already busy creating great tools that will require no coding skill to do really impressive 3D data visualizations using maps }
