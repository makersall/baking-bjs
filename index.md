Datachefs is a [Makers All](https://makersall.org/) initiative to explore making working with data more accessible to communities from Harlem to Harlan County and to users in corporations, nonprofits, and other organizations who aren't coders -- and in doing so, help to diversify the tech industry.

Currently, there are 2 Datachefs projects:


- [BabylonJS](babylonjs/): explore making augmented/virtual reality programming more accessible by smoothing the learning curve for using the BabylonJS framework for making creative data visualizations

- [Learning Deep Learning](learning-deep-learning/): Using FastAI's Deep Learning libraries to explore metaphors and other ways of teaching deep learning accessible to a broader community

NOTE: This is a draft site that's mostly being used for experiments -- it's not ready for public use.
